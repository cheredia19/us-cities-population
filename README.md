New York City has recorded a population loss of **more than 600 thousand people** between 2020 and 2024, according to [data from 300 selected cities in the United States](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataanalyst001/population-of-all-us-cities-2024). Apart from NYC, the population of the other 21 cities from 16 states has declined by more than 10K. Five of those are in California.

Ninety-five cities from 29 US states have seen their population diminish between 1K and 9K. Twenty-nine out of these 95 cities belong to California. No other state registered more than seven cities with such losses.
